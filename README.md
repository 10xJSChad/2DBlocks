## Downloading

To download, simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/glibg10b/2DBlocks/releases) tab and click on 2dblocks-portable-x64-vX.Y.Z.exe

## Usage

Simply open the .exe file you downloaded. No installation needed.

After generating the world, type `help` to see what you can do.

*Tip: For most commands, you only have to type the first letter (e.g. `h` instead of `help`). For some, you need to type two letters (e.g. `pl` instead of `place`, `pr` instead of `print`)*
