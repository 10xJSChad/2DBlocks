A game that lets you play with characters in 2D space

- Functions should return std::string instead of printing
  Should have a border that looks like:

####
#  #
#  #
####

  Grid dimensions should be customizable
  Each item in grid should be an ASCII character
  User should be able to place, destroy and look at tiles
  User should be able to quit
  Destroyed tiles should be spaces
# Print information about how world was generated

Windows, x64

1. How should I manage code files (how should I group functions, structs and namespaces)
2. What should my struct hierarchy look like (I guess I'll know more after going through **Chapter 11 - Basic object-oriented programming**)
3. How do I add parameters to functions non-destructively (I'm guessing function overloading)
4. If I use a function from a namespace inside another function in the same namespace, should I still prefix the function call with `mynamespace::`?

Issues: 
Can't generate world from function
